Start phpmyadmin eg: on dt-u10204 
http://php.home37


MAKE A COPY OF DEPO11 eg 26sep13depo11 	
	*	(do not use - in the table name)
	*	USE the date of script execution date. eg Today's date if running the scripts today.
	*	Create a folder eg: 01jul17 to contain the following scripts and files:
	1.	sed-mny-today.sh
	2.	cleancsv.sh
	3.	sed-mnyTOmysql.sh
	4.	mnyTOmysql
	5.	From ms money app. eg all20jun17.csv and RENAME it to all.csv

Tip: Create a template folder to keep files 1- 4 and copy & paste the folder to new location and rename it to eg 01jul17. Then paste the ms money file to work on.

Run the script sed-mny-today.sh from the newly created folder to work on the all.csv file. This will output a clean csv file with today's date eg: all01jul17 in it's name.

	make a copy of all01jul17 and rename it as ddMMYY to use in query 4 of workingquery... file to compare

PHPMYADMIN: ON MNY DATABASE

Import the all01jul17 into db as table eg all01Jul17 (ensure the import is into mny database & not depo11 table)

	
	Ensure the first letter to the month is Capital eg: all01Jul17
	Rename the imported table if table is numbered

CHECK BOX: The first line of the file contains the table column names (if this is unchecked, the first line will become part of the data)

Run the script sed-mnyTOmysql.sh. This will output  file workingquery01jul17 for example. Go down to the Working quries section and perfom 1 - 3 queires for updating and query 4 for comparison etc.

Query: 1

In order to add new records to db we need to know which are the new accounts in ms money.
create a comparison between 26sep13depo11 account list & all2feb12 and save it as view?/table:as diff2feb12

eg: 1

CREATE VIEW diff2feb12 AS
SELECT * FROM all2feb12
WHERE all2feb12.account
NOT IN (
SELECT 26sep13depo1.account
FROM 26sep13depo11
WHERE 26sep13depo11.account=all2feb12.account)

template query : 1

tables			names
diff2feb12		diffNOW

all2feb12		allNOW

bkdepo11	   bkdepo11


sed -e "s/difftable/diff$NOW/" -e "s/allNOW/all$NOW/" -e  "s/bkdepo11/$NOW\depo11/" mnyTOmysql

CREATE VIEW difftable  AS
SELECT * FROM allNOW
WHERE allNOW.account
NOT IN (
SELECT bkdepo11.account
FROM bkdepo11
WHERE bkdepo11.account=allNOW.account)


---------------------------------
Query: 2

Adding new records based on new deposit list difference view eg. diff4feb12

eg

INSERT INTO depo11 (account,bal)
SELECT account, bal
FROM diff4feb12

template query: 2

INSERT INTO depo11 (account,bal)
SELECT account, bal
FROM difftable

---------------------------------

Query: 3

Updating the new amounts in depo11 based on latest mny table all2feb12.

eg:

UPDATE depo11, all13dec12 SET depo11.bal = all13dec12.bal WHERE depo11.Account = all13dec12.Account

template query: 3

UPDATE depo11, allNOW SET depo11.bal = allNOW.bal WHERE depo11.Account = allNOW.Account


---------------------------------

Query: 4

all13jun14 --> allNOW

Compare MS Money allDDMMYR account,bal with depo11 (note the dif in the above query. It uses depo11 as outer query

eg: 

SELECT * FROM depo11
WHERE depo11.account 
NOT IN (
SELECT all13jun14.account
FROM all13jun14)

template query: 

SELECT * FROM depo11
WHERE depo11.account 
NOT IN (
SELECT allNOW.account
FROM allNOW)
